// openClaudePTY allocates a pseudo-terminal pair suitable for hosting a
// Claude Code CLI subprocess. The returned ptmx is the master end: the
// parent reads claude's stdout and writes stdin through it. The returned
// tty is the slave end: the caller must set cmd.Stdin and cmd.Stdout to
// it BEFORE calling cmd.Start, and close it in the parent immediately
// AFTER cmd.Start so only the child holds the slave open.
//
// Why a PTY and not a pipe: Node.js (the runtime the claude CLI is built
// on) detects whether process.stdout is a TTY. On a pipe, Node switches to
// block-buffered stdout — it holds emitted bytes in an internal 4–8 KiB
// userspace buffer until the buffer fills or the process exits. Small
// stream-json events (a typical "hello" response is ~200 bytes) never
// fill the buffer and therefore never reach the daemon until the CLI is
// closed. On a TTY, Node uses line buffering instead and flushes on every
// newline, which matches exactly what the daemon's line-based parser
// expects. Allocating a PTY sidesteps the problem entirely from the
// Go side, without requiring any changes to the claude CLI or a coreutils
// dependency like stdbuf.
//
// The PTY is configured immediately after allocation:
//
//  1. A huge window size (10000×10000) is set so Node does not wrap
//     stream-json events at terminal-width boundaries. Cost is zero (four
//     integers in an ioctl); benefit is that arbitrarily long events
//     (large tool outputs, long assistant responses, multi-KB diffs)
//     pass through unwrapped.
//
//  2. The master side is placed in raw mode via term.MakeRaw. This
//     disables input echo (so the JSON messages we write to the master
//     are not reflected back to us on the master's read side),
//     canonical mode (so input is not line-buffered inside the kernel
//     before reaching the child), and output post-processing (so LF
//     output from the child is not translated to CRLF). Without raw
//     mode, every byte we write as stdin would appear interleaved in
//     stdout and the parser would fail on malformed JSON.
