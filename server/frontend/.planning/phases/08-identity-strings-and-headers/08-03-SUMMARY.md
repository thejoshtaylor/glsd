# Phase 08 Plan 03: Identity Strings and Headers Summary

**sed-based bulk replacement of "Track Your Shit" with "GSD VibeFlow" across all 178 source file headers (28 Rust, 149 TypeScript/TSX, 1 CSS), leaving zero legacy references in committed source files**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~8 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-21T17:32:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-21T17:37:31Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 179 (28 .rs + 149 .ts/.tsx + 1 .css + 1 generated .json)

## Accomplishments
- Replaced all 28 Rust file headers (`src-tauri/` `.rs` files including `build.rs`) in one sed pass
- Replaced all 149 TypeScript/TSX file headers under `src/` in one sed pass
- Updated `src/styles/globals.css` CSS block comment header
- Fixed stale `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json` generated schema (tracked in git, contained legacy description)
- Verified `pnpm build` exits 0 — no breakage from header changes
- Confirmed 4 pre-existing test failures are unrelated to rename (verified via `git stash` test run)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Bulk-update all .rs file headers** - `b562005` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Bulk-update all .ts/.tsx/.css file headers and run final verification** - `f5e6f04` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** _(to be added in final commit)_

## Files Created/Modified
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Header updated: `// GSD VibeFlow - Library Root...`
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Header updated: `// GSD VibeFlow - Main Entry Point`
- `src-tauri/build.rs` - Header updated: `// GSD VibeFlow - Build Script`
- All 20 `src-tauri/src/commands/*.rs` files - Headers updated
- `src-tauri/src/db/mod.rs`, `db/tracing_layer.rs`, `models/mod.rs`, `pty/mod.rs`, `headless.rs`, `security.rs` - Headers updated
- `src/main.tsx` - Header updated: `// GSD VibeFlow - Main Entry Point`
- `src/App.tsx` - Header updated: `// GSD VibeFlow - Main App Component`
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Header updated: `/* GSD VibeFlow - Global Styles`
- All 146 remaining `.ts/.tsx` files under `src/` - Headers updated
- `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json` - Description field updated (auto-fix)

## Decisions Made
- Updated generated `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json` even though it is a build artifact — it is tracked in git and would have left a visible legacy reference in the committed codebase
- Pre-existing test failures (projects.test.tsx "Import"/"New Project" button not found, main-layout.test.tsx "Dashboard" not found) are pre-existing from phase 08-01/08-02 UI changes, not caused by header rename

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Updated stale generated capabilities schema**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (final codebase-wide verification)
- **Issue:** `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json` is tracked in git and contained `"Default permissions for Track Your Shit"` — source `capabilities/default.json` was already updated in a prior plan but the gen file was stale
- **Fix:** `sed -i '' 's|Default permissions for Track Your Shit|Default permissions for GSD VibeFlow|g' src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json`
- **Files modified:** `src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json`
- **Verification:** `grep "Track Your Shit" src-tauri/gen/schemas/capabilities.json` returns zero results
- **Committed in:** `f5e6f04` (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (Rule 1 - stale generated file)
**Impact on plan:** Essential for achieving zero legacy references in committed files. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
- `grep -rn "Track Your Shit" src-tauri/` initially showed many matches in `src-tauri/target/` — these are compiled binary artifacts not committed to git and are irrelevant to the rebrand goal
- Pre-existing test failures (4 tests in 2 files) confirmed via `git stash && pnpm test` — same failures existed before our changes

## Self-Check

### Files Exist
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` line 1: `// GSD VibeFlow - Library Root (Tauri app setup, command registration, event listeners)` ✓
- `src/main.tsx` line 1: `// GSD VibeFlow - Main Entry Point` ✓
- `src/App.tsx` line 1: `// GSD VibeFlow - Main App Component` ✓
- `src/styles/globals.css` line 1: `/* GSD VibeFlow - Global Styles` ✓

### Commits Exist
- `b562005` — feat(08-03): bulk-update all .rs file headers to GSD VibeFlow ✓
- `f5e6f04` — feat(08-03): bulk-update all .ts/.tsx/.css file headers to GSD VibeFlow ✓

### Zero Legacy References
- `grep -rc "Track Your Shit" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.css"` → 0 ✓
- `grep -rc "Track Your Shit" src-tauri/ --include="*.rs"` → 0 ✓
- `pnpm build` → exit 0 ✓

## Self-Check: PASSED

## Next Phase Readiness
- Phase 08 rebrand complete — zero "Track Your Shit" references remain in any committed source file
- All file headers read `// GSD VibeFlow - [purpose]`
- Ready for Phase 09: Visual Identity
- Pre-existing test failures in projects.test.tsx and main-layout.test.tsx should be addressed in Phase 10: Dead Code and Quality
