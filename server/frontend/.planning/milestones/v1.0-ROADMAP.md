# Roadmap: Track Your Shit — GSD-2 Integration

## Overview

This milestone adds GSD-2 support to a mature Tauri desktop app that already has complete GSD-1 integration. The work proceeds in dependency order: a Rust backend foundation (version detection + file parsing) gates all UI features, which then build outward from the simplest data reads (health widget) through independent feature panels (worktrees) to the most complex process-management and aggregation features (headless mode, visualizer). GSD-1 projects continue working without any modification throughout.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 6: Reactive Updates and Headless Session Polish** - gsd2:file-changed invalidation for Worktrees and Visualizer; persist headless log buffer across tab navigation; documentation fixes (gap closure) (completed 2026-03-21)
- [x] **Phase 7: Reactive Milestones/Slices/Tasks Invalidation** - Add gsd2:file-changed invalidation for Milestones/Slices/Tasks tabs; fix ROADMAP.md doc checkbox (tech debt closure) (completed 2026-03-21)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: GSD-2 Backend Foundation
**Goal**: The app correctly identifies GSD-2, GSD-1, and unversioned projects and provides Rust command infrastructure for reading all .gsd/ file structures, with GSD-1 commands actively rejecting GSD-2 project IDs
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: VERS-01, VERS-02, VERS-03, VERS-04, PARS-01, PARS-02, PARS-03, PARS-04, PARS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening a GSD-2 project shows a "GSD-2" detection result; opening a GSD-1 project shows "GSD-1"; opening an unversioned project shows "none"
  2. Calling any GSD-1 Rust command with a GSD-2 project ID returns a typed error rather than empty data
  3. The `gsd2_list_milestones` command returns milestone directories with correct ID, title, done status, and dependencies by reading .gsd/milestones/
  4. The `gsd2_derive_state` command returns active milestone/slice/task IDs and M/S/T progress counters
  5. File changes inside .gsd/ emit `gsd2:file-changed` events that the frontend can subscribe to
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — DB migration, gsd2.rs module creation, version detection command, project import hooks
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — GSD-1 guard rails on 29 existing commands, .gsd/ file watcher extension
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — File parsing commands (list_milestones, get_milestone, get_slice, derive_state, get_roadmap_progress)

### Phase 2: Health Widget, Adaptive UI, and Reactive Updates
**Goal**: GSD-2 projects show a live health widget with budget, blockers, and progress counters; the project detail UI uses correct terminology per version; project list cards show GSD version badges
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: HLTH-01, HLTH-02, HLTH-03, HLTH-04, TERM-01, TERM-02, TERM-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A GSD-2 project's health widget shows budget spent vs ceiling (from metrics.json), environment error/warning counts, active milestone/slice/task, and any current blocker
  2. The health widget updates within 10 seconds of a .gsd/ file change (either via file watcher event or polling)
  3. A GSD-2 project's detail tabs are labeled "Milestones", "Slices", "Tasks"; a GSD-1 project's tabs remain "Phases", "Plans", "Tasks"
  4. Project list cards and the dashboard show a "GSD-2" or "GSD-1" badge per project
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Rust gsd2_get_health command, gsd_version data pipeline, frontend TypeScript types and React Query hooks
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Health widget component, adaptive GSD tab set, version badges on project cards, file watcher extension

### Phase 3: Worktrees Panel
**Goal**: Users with GSD-2 worktrees can see all active worktrees per project, preview what changed in each, and remove them safely
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: WORK-01, WORK-02, WORK-03, WORK-04, WORK-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Worktrees tab in a GSD-2 project lists all active worktrees with name, branch, and path (canonicalized to handle macOS /var → /private/var symlinks)
  2. Selecting a worktree shows a summary of files added, modified, and removed vs main before any remove action
  3. Clicking Remove on a worktree removes it from the filesystem and deletes the associated branch; the list refreshes to reflect the change
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Rust backend commands (list, remove, diff), TypeScript types, invoke wrappers, query keys, React Query hooks
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Gsd2WorktreesTab component, barrel export, tab insertion in project detail page

### Phase 4: Headless Mode and Visualizer
**Goal**: Users can start, monitor, and stop GSD-2 headless sessions from the app and view a full progress tree with cost/token metrics across all milestones and slices
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: HDLS-01, HDLS-02, HDLS-03, HDLS-04, HDLS-05, HDLS-06, VIZ-01, VIZ-02, VIZ-03, VIZ-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Headless tab shows session status (idle/running/complete) with Start and Stop controls; tapping Start creates a PTY session and streams JSON output to the panel
  2. Stopping a headless session or closing the app terminates the process and releases the .gsd/auto.lock file with no orphaned processes
  3. The Visualizer tab renders a milestone → slice → task progress tree where each node shows done/active/pending status
  4. The Visualizer tab shows cost and token metrics aggregated by phase (milestone) and by model, plus a chronological execution timeline of completed slices/tasks
  5. The "query snapshot" panel in the Headless tab shows the last { state, next, cost } result from a one-shot gsd headless query
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Rust backend: HeadlessSessionRegistry, headless commands (query/start/stop), visualizer data command, can_safely_close/force_close_all, lib.rs registration
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Frontend types, invoke wrappers, query keys, React Query hooks, useHeadlessSession hook
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Headless tab UI, Visualizer tab UI, project.tsx tab insertion, barrel export, close-warning extension

| 7. Reactive Milestones/Slices/Tasks Invalidation | 1/1 | Complete   | 2026-03-21 |

### Phase 5: GSD-2 Milestones, Slices, and Tasks UI
**Goal**: The GSD-2 Milestones, Slices, and Tasks tabs display real data by connecting the existing Rust parsing commands to the frontend via TS invoke wrappers and React Query hooks
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (all 5 parsing commands exist in Rust)
**Requirements**: PARS-01, PARS-02, PARS-03, PARS-04, PARS-05 (frontend wiring — commands already verified at Rust level)
**Gap Closure**: Closes integration gaps identified in v1.0 audit — parsing commands unreachable from UI
**Plans:** 2/2 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — TypeScript invoke wrappers, interface types, query key entries, React Query hooks for all 5 parsing commands
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Gsd2MilestonesTab, Gsd2SlicesTab, Gsd2TasksTab components, barrel export, project.tsx tab wiring

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Milestones GSD-2 tab shows a list of milestones with ID, title, and done/pending status (from `gsd2_list_milestones`)
  2. Clicking a milestone expands or navigates to show its slices (from `gsd2_get_milestone`)
  3. The Slices tab shows a flat list of all slices with ID, title, and task count; clicking a slice shows its tasks (from `gsd2_get_slice`)
  4. The Tasks tab shows all active/pending tasks derived from `gsd2_derive_state` with status indicators
  5. All three tabs include loading, error, and empty states

### Phase 6: Reactive Updates and Headless Session Polish
**Goal**: Worktrees and Visualizer refresh reactively on .gsd/ file changes; headless session log rows survive tab navigation; minor documentation gaps closed
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: N/A — no new v1 requirements; closes integration and flow gaps from v1.0 audit
**Gap Closure**: Closes HDLS-04 flow gap, WORK-05/VIZ-04 reactive invalidation gaps, and documentation gaps
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Reactive invalidation for Worktrees/Visualizer, headless session log persistence via prop lift, documentation gap fixes

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Editing a .gsd/ file while the Worktrees tab is open causes the worktree list to refresh within 2 seconds (not waiting for 30s poll)
  2. Editing a .gsd/ file while the Visualizer tab is open causes the visualizer data to refresh within 2 seconds
  3. Navigating away from the Headless tab during a running session and navigating back shows all previously accumulated log rows (none lost)
  4. ROADMAP.md Phase 1 progress table is accurate; 02-01 and 03-01 SUMMARY files have `requirements-completed` frontmatter

### Phase 7: Reactive Milestones/Slices/Tasks Invalidation
**Goal**: Milestones, Slices, and Tasks tabs refresh within 2 seconds of a .gsd/ file change (currently wait up to 30s); ROADMAP.md doc checkbox corrected
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: N/A — no new v1 requirements; closes tech debt from v1.0 audit
**Gap Closure**: Closes tech debt items: missing gsd2:file-changed invalidation for Milestones/Slices/Tasks tabs; ROADMAP.md Phase 6 checkbox fix
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Add gsd2Milestones, gsd2DerivedState, gsd2Milestone (prefix), gsd2Slice (prefix) invalidations to use-gsd-file-watcher.ts; fix ROADMAP.md checkbox

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Editing a .gsd/ file while the Milestones tab is open causes the milestones list to refresh within 2 seconds (not waiting for 30s poll)
  2. Editing a .gsd/ file while the Slices or Tasks tab is open causes those tabs to refresh within 2 seconds
  3. ROADMAP.md 06-01-PLAN.md checkbox reads `[x]` (not `[ ]`)
